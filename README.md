# ArtificialEaselNetworkX

## Description

A generative adversarial network (GAN) framework for AI-driven NFT art creation, utilizing a novel style-transfer approach with attention-based neural layers and on-chain provenance verification through cryptographic hashes.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for the ArtificialEaselNetworkX software project:
- "Trains neural networks on large datasets using parallelized GPU acceleration",
- "Provides realtime image synthesis and manipulation using generative adversarial networks",
- "Integrates computer vision libraries for object detection and segmentation",
- "Supports customizable neural network architectures with modular layer design",
- "Offers automated hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization",
- "Includes visualization tools for network topology and performance analysis",
- "Enables distributed training across multiple machines using parameter server architecture"
- Let me know if you'd like me to adjust or add anything!
